Sceme category in the plist file. Also, users must register their own App on the Facebook developers site at
facebook.com/developers.

2. The free open source library ASIHTTPRequest is also needed for the QR Post for iPhone library. Please download
it at http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/ and follow the setup instructions.
